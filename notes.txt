The flow is a little complicated, but straight forward. Users are clicking the google button which fires off an endpoint called /auth/google, then we're redirecting them to the oAuth provider, assuming they grant permission, they'll be redirected back to our site with a custom callback. Something like /auth/provider/cb. From there we need to check if they are a new user, we add them to the database. If not, then we need to sign them up.
